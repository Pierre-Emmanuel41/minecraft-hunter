If you are reading this, you are about to add a new dictionary to this project. Thank you a lot.
Please follow the step below in order to add a dictionary in one commit:

1) Check if the dictionary you are about to add does not exists.

2) In the folder src/main/resources/dictionaries, create a new folder named as the dictionary language (ex : language = german, src/main/resources/dictionaries/German).

3) Create the dictionary xml file, you could also copy past one of the existing dictionary (ex : Hunter.xml).

4) Update the tag <locales> for each language supported by the new dictionary (see other existing dictionaries).

5) Write the translation of each code in the new language.

6) Update the method registerDictionaries in class HunterPlugin by adding the code below.
   The <Name of the new folder> has to be replaced by the new folder you have created (here : German) :
   // Registering <Name of the new folder> dictionaries
   registerDictionary("<Name of the new folder>", dictionaries);
	

7) Update the pom.xml in order to export your new dictionary in the jar. The code below should be added after the last <resource> tag.
   The <Name of the new folder> has to be replaced by the new folder you have created (here : German) :
   <resource>
      <targetPath>./resources/dictionaries/<Name of the new folder></targetPath>
      <filtering>true</filtering>
      <directory>${basedir}/src/main/resources/dictionaries/<Name of the new folder></directory>
      <includes>
         <include>*.xml</include>
      </includes>
   </resource>

8) Commit and create a pull request.
